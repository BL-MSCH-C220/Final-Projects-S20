# Corona Boi
## by Team EvilChaos
### For BL-MSCH-C220 at Indiana University, Bloomington
### April 29, 2020

This game was developed as a final project for C220 as part of a 48-hour game jam. 

When we considered the theme of Corona, we thought about it this way: What if we turned social distancing into a space shooter?

These are the struggles and surprises we encountered as we developed it: Power ups, proper looking assets, implementing sound, visibility of the bullets, implementing particles, making sections of the background to make a whole background, we weren't able to get the power up sounds to work even though we spent hours on it.

These are the technologies and resources we used: Piskel, Godot Engine, Audacity, Reason, Freesound.

This is the objective of the game: Shoot as many infected people as you can with Lysol to avoid getting COVID-19. Drink coffee to increase your speed and grab masks to shield yourself.

This is how the game is played: Use WASD to move, use space/left mouse buttion to shoot.

Future plans: We will let it die along with COVID-19.
