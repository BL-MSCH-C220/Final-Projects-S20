Make your harrowing and heroic escape through the heart of the city after a local outbreak, shooting your way through the Coronavirus with our patented Sanitizer Shooter: Now with 70% more bullet! Can you beat the Coronavirus?

This game was developed as a final project for C220 as part of a 48-hour game jam. With the given theme of the Corona virus with the 2019-2020 pandemic of COVID-19 and social distance in effect, we considered what could be a light-hearted way to poke fun at Corona. Thus, Covid Escape was born.

The Objective of the game is to defeat all the Coronavirus entities without dying from them. Use the health and ammo packs to refresh your supplies, and beware the Corona's ability to stack and gang up and do even more damage to the player!

This project had alot of minor difficulties and hiccups, mostly with random lag issues with too many materials attempted to be rendered at once really bogged down the systems. The music was surprisingly difficult to implement due to its insistance on Not Looping. These are the technologies and resources we used: Blender, Audacity, GODOT, kenny.nl, open-source sounds for sound effects.

Future plans: We could protentially flesh out even more of the game and add other levels to this to create an even more fulfilling experience.
