Project: Corona Escape
Group's repository: https://github.com/shermy99/Final_Project



What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?
How to design power ups

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?
Running away from a virus outbreak

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?
Power up design, which I have yet to fully design and understand

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?
Add more levels to increase the playability of the game. I would also make a flashlight or similar effect
as it took a while to find the virus in the very dark environment once I had ample ammunition.
The virus and bullets could also be faster to give the player a better sense that they are in danger.
Finally, the number of enemies clutters the space in the edit window. The group could have applied the node
child method we used and made enemies a scene to remove said clutter. Same goes for the pickups.

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?
Coding was easy to understand

Is it clear that every group member participated?
Yes

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
Only one person is listed on the license

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
Maybe add in more descriptive words in place of the swearing
 

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.
I like the amount of features that are added that we didn't dicuss in as much length about during class.

How many of your points would you allocate to this project?
2.5
