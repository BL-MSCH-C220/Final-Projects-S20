Group's repository: https://github.com/shermy99/Final_Project



What is something you learned by reviewing this group's project?
    3D models can have a lot of details and make the environment much more complicated than 2D. 
 

In what ways does this game reflect the theme?
    The player is shooting corona particles.
 

What is something you saw in this group's project that you would like to apply to your own future games?
    The inclusion of a detailed background to set the stage for the play area.
 

What suggestions would you have for this group to improve the game?
    Work on the play area boundaries, at every corner it was possible to walk out of the map and into the void.
 

Was there anything in the GDScript that was confusing to you? If so, what?
    No not really, I had worked with a similar core project in a prevous assignment.
 

Is it clear that every group member participated?
    Yes, every author has commit pushed to master in Github and the contributions are very descriptive in the README.md
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
    Yes
 

What is something the group could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
    There is no direct statement describing the game as a 3D shooter, this could be stated.
 

Pay a compliment to the group based on the quality of the game.
    The environment was great and very well designed! The lighting was great and generated a nice atmosphere, as well as providing some comic relief (the glowing toilet). The gun having an attached flashlight was also really cool.
