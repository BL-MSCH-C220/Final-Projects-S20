# Final-Projects—Spring 2020

The spring 2022 game jam was held from 27—29 April 2020. The theme for the jam was "Corona". The class members organized into groups (2–4 members) and created a game from scratch in 49 hours consistent with that theme.

The groups presented their projects in class, and the projects are kept here for future reference. The grading criteria were as follows:
 * [7 points] A playable game
 * [2] No syntax or runtime errors
 * [3] Is a reflection of the theme
 * [5] It is obvious that every member contributed
 * [2] It is appropriately licensed, and the README.md conforms to the specified format
 * [1] Screenshot or gameplay video
