This game was developed as a final project for C220 as part of a 48-hour game jam. 

When we considered the theme of coronavirus, we thought about it this way: We wanted to make a game that was fun, creative, and unique. Trump's suggestion to inject disinfectants inside our body was brought to the spotlight. By basing a game around this idea, it met the three criterias we wanted. This game is intended to make people laugh and have a good time!

These are the struggles and surprises we encountered as we developed it: We could not find the ideal time for everyone to communicate simultaneously. Luckily, we used Discord, and we were all on the right page. Surpisingly, everyone knew their roles, and everyone worked effectively.

These are the technologies and resources we used: Discord, GitHub, Godot, Piskelapp, IU Canvas.

This is the objective of the game: A doctor is trying to get to work. He lives in an alternative reality where no seems to believe that COVID-19 is real. He encounters lots infected people. They try to approach him. Luckily, he finds low-dose projectile curing injections that can cure people before they get to him. He can't be exposed to the coronavirus since he has a history of respiratory problems.

This is how the game is played: You play as the doctor, and you are walking through the city. You use your injections to cure people from the coronavirus before they get to you.

Future plans: A continued and updated version of this game will include added vehicles, power-ups, boss levels, and checkpoints.
